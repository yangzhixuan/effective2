Module      : Control.Effect.WithName
Description : Making copies of existing effects with names
License     : BSD-3-Clause
Maintainer  : Zhixuan Yang
Stability   : experimental

This module provides an \'imitater\' effect that clones an existing effect.
The effect @WithName name eff@ is simply a newtype wrapper of @eff@, so the
existing handlers of @eff@ can be transported to be handlers of @WithName name eff@.
A typical use case of this effect is for having multiple instances of mutable state.
